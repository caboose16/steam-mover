# Steam Mover  
A tool to move multiple games from one drive to another. It displays a list of games on each drive and how much space each game takes up.  
Program Limitations: Currently Only works with Steam installed in the default directory on the C drive.  

If you want a program with a GUI that works with Steam in any location use Steam Mover (I should've checked if the name was taken) at http://www.traynier.com/software/steammover
